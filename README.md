# PROJECT: Facial Key-point Detection üôÇ

## Project Overview

This project was part of the Coursera's guided project *Emotion AI: Facial Key-points Detection*.

My certificate of completition can be found on my [Linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/lorenamelodev).

In this hands-on project, we will train deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks to detect 15 facial key-points. This project could be practically used for detecting customer emotions and facial expressions.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the theory and intuition behind Deep Neural Networks, Residual Nets, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Apply Python libraries to import, pre-process and visualize images.
- Perform data augmentation to increase the size of the datasets and improve model generalization capability.
- Perform image normalization and prepare train data.
- Build a deep learning model based on Residual Convolutional Neural Network and Residual blocks using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend.
- Compile and fit Deep Learning model to training data.
- Assess the performance of trained deep learning model and ensure its generalization using various KPIs such as accuracy and RMSE.
- Improve network performance using regularization techniques such as dropout.
